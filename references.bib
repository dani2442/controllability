  abstract = {In the context of data-driven control, persistence of excitation (PE) of an input sequence is defined in terms of a rank condition on the Hankel matrix of the input data. For nonlinear systems, recent results employed rank conditions involving collected input and state/output data, for which no guidelines are available on how to satisfy them a priori. In this paper, we first show that a set of discrete impulses is guaranteed to be persistently exciting for any controllable LTI system. Based on this result, for certain classes of nonlinear systems, we guarantee persistence of excitation of sequences of basis functions a priori, by design of the physical input only.},

Control Lett., vol. 54, no. 4, pp. 325–329, 2005 plays an important role in system identification and data-driven control. One of the assumptions for the fundamental lemma is that the underlying linear timeinvariant system is controllable. In this paper, the fundamental lemma is extended to address system identification for uncontrollable systems. Then, a data-driven algebraic test is derived to check whether the underlying system is controllable or not. An algorithm based on the singular value decomposition of a Hankel matrix constructed from the data is provided to implement the developed test. The algorithm has cubic computational cost. Examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.},

We will take into account prior knowledge on system-theoretic properties of the system, in particular, controllability and stabilizability. For this, we extend the notion of universal inputs to incorporate prior knowledge on the system. An input is called universal for identification (resp., stabilization) if, when applied to any system complying with the prior knowledge, it results in data suitable for identification (resp., stabilization) regardless of the initial condition. We provide a full characterization of such universal inputs. In addition, we discuss online experiment design using prior knowledge, and we study cases where this approach results in the shortest possible experiment for identification and stabilization.},

  abstract = {The use of persistently exciting data has recently been popularized in the context of data-driven analysis and control. Such data have been used to assess system-theoretic properties and to construct control laws, without using a system model. Persistency of excitation is a strong condition that also allows unique identification of the underlying dynamical system from the data within a given model class. In this article, we develop a new framework in order to work with data that are not necessarily persistently exciting. Within this framework, we investigate necessary and sufficient conditions on the informativity of data for several data-driven analysis and control problems. For certain analysis and design problems, our results reveal that persistency of excitation is not necessary. In fact, in these cases, data-driven analysis/control is possible while the combination of (unique) system identification and model-based control is not. For certain other control problems, our results justify the use of persistently exciting data, as data-driven control is possible only with data that are informative for system identification.},

This result has profound implications for system identification and data-driven control, and has seen a revival over the last few years. The purpose of this paper is to extend Willems' lemma to the situation where multiple (possibly short) system trajectories are given instead of a single long one. To this end, we introduce a notion of collective persistency of excitation. We will then show that all trajectories of a linear system can be obtained from a given finite number of trajectories, as long as these are collectively persistently exciting. We will demonstrate that this result enables the identification of linear systems from data sets with missing data samples. Additionally, we show that the result is of practical significance in data-driven control of unstable systems.},
